A REST API that is hosted on my raspberry pi 4. Has different categories of endpoints which all serve different purposes. Most of them are GET endpoints, to make it as easy as possible to interact with. It's always hosted over a connection with SSL, to make sure all traffic is secured.

## Endpoints

There is a multitude of RESTful endpoints, which all required certain ***privileges***.

### All available privileges

Privilege | Description

minecraft_command | Allows for performing any RCON command on the connected minecraft server

### Endpoints

These are endpoints which serve as a way to find all available endpoints of the API in a list. I use these as a way to quickly test new endpoints from my Siri Shortcuts.

------------ | ------------- | ------------- |-------------
/endpoints/all | GET | None | Returns all available endpoints
/endpoints/search/*string* | GET | None | Returns all endpoints which contains the search term

### Economy

All endpoints which allow access to the personal finance part of this API. In the following endpoints, all URL parameters which are followed by `[]` can be specified multiple times in order to specify multiple of whatever the specific endpoint retrieves. All URL parameters which are followed by a `?` is considered optional and will usually make the specific endpoint return all possible values instead of any specific value. To see what payloads are expected by `POST` & `PUT` endpoints, click the `POST` & `PUT` links on the respective table row.
