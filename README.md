A REST API that used to be hosted on my Raspberry Pi 4, hence the name. Is now hosted as a docker container on another server. 

Check it out here: [https://api.dcronqvist.se](https://api.dcronqvist.se)

## Authentication

To authenticate against the API, you must have a valid login (username & password), which you POST to [https://api.dcronqvist.se/v1/auth/login](https://api.dcronqvist.se/v1/). Once authorized, you'll be given a token which will be valid for the following 60 minutes, after that you must acquire a new token to remain authorized. 

The acquired token must be supplied in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests. The only endpoint which does not require the `Authorization` header is of course the `/v1/auth/login` endpoint, as that wouldn't make much sense.

## Endpoints

There is a multitude of RESTful endpoints, which all require certain ***privileges***.

### Available privileges

------------ | -------------
economy | Base privilege for most endpoints regarding economy
